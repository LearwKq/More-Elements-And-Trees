The Story of the Mini Uranium Golem:

Since it is made of uranium, it is considered a radiation mob. Since he is affected by this radiation and has difficulty in turning his head, he cannot turn his head properly and walks very fast. He is a harmless type of mob, so no matter how much you hit him, he will not attack you, and if you pick up a uranium ingot, he will follow you. If you kill him, 2 uranium blocks will drop out of him, and you will get 18 uranium ingots in total.

The Gray's Story:

He was a human who lived in a dump and was actually friends with Slenderman (his previous human form). Afterwards, Slenderman was kidnapped and subjected to an experiment and transformed into The Gray form. The professors tied their arms upside down and left them alone because they didn't want to deal with it. They also tie their legs upside down to avoid confusion. If you kill him, 1 netherite ingot will drop out of him
